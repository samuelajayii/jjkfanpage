                <p id="first-para">Yuji Itadori is an unnaturally fit high school student living in Sendai. On his deathbed, his grandfather instills two powerful messages within Yuji: "always help others" and "die surrounded by people." Yuji's friends at the Occult Club attract Curses to their school when they unsealed a rotten finger talisman which Yuji swallowed to protect Megumi Fushiguro and their friends, becoming host to a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna. Due to Sukuna's evil nature, all sorcerers are required to exorcise him (and by extension, Yuji) immediately. But upon seeing Yuji retaining control over his body, Megumi's teacher Satoru Gojo brings him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School.</p>
